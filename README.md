# Genetic Algorithms for Shortest Path Routing in Urban Areas
This repository holds all the relevant files produced during the final project for the subject Advanced Methods in Applied Statisics 2025 at KÃ¸benhavns Universitet. 
The main objective of the project was to understand and apply genetic algorithms to find the shortest path in a town/city. In this case, the vast majority of testing was done in the Copenhagen Municipality but the code is adaptable to other places.
